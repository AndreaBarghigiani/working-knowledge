In this lesson we start working with the [[window.fetch()]] API that returns a [[Promise]] because we make an HTTP request that's an asynchronous operation, so [[window.fetch()]] returns a `responsePromise`.
```js
const responsePromise = fetch(API_URL . 'films');
```
A promise is a placeholder for the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The result could be a success or a failure.

The promise can be in three different states:
* **Pending** - before the result is ready
* **Fulfilled** - if the result become available
* **Rejected** - if an error happen

When a promise is no more pending we refer to it as *settled* and it can no longer change state.

In order to use the responsePromise we need to call the `.then()` method and we attach a callback that is called once the promise has fulfilled.

```js
const API_URL = "https://starwars.egghead.training/";

const responsePromise = fetch(API_URL + "films");
responsePromise.then(response => {
	// Do stuff with the response when fulfilled
})
```
Since we're working with API data the response of a fetch call can be pretty full of information but in order to parse the body of the response from the server we need to make use of the [[.json()]] method that it'll return a [[Promise]] as well.

Again to use the Promise that has been returned we need to `return` it and pass it to a new `.then()` creating a Promise chain.

```js
responsePromise.then(response => {
  return response.json();
}).then(films => {
	// Do stuff with the json() response
});
```

The rest of the lesson focuses on how to make the code more elegant and better organized but does not talk at all about Promises.
