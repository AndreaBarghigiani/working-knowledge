This is the completed code from previous lesson:
```js
const API_URL = "https://starwars.egghead.training/";
const output = document.getElementById("output");

output.innerText = "Loading ...";

fetch(API_URL + "films")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(films => {
      output.innerText = getFilmTitles(films);
    });
  
function getFilmTitles(films) {
  return films
    .slice()
    .sort((a, b) => a.episode_id - b.episode_id)
    .map(film => `${film.episode_id}. ${film.title}`)
    .join("\n");
}
```
This code is not *"protected"* against errors though, simply trying to get the response from a wrong URL will get us some errors that will be hard to debug:

When we use the `.then()` method we can specify two kind of handler (fn). We already seen the *onFulfilled* one from previous examples that is the one called whenever the Promise changes from pending to fulfilled but we can specify a second handler that is the *onRejected*:
```js
fetch(API_URL + "films").then(
  // onFulfilled
  response => {
      console.log(response)
  },
  // onRejected
  error => {
    console.warn(error)
  }
);
```
As for the state of the Promise once settled also for the handlers we can call them only one of them depending of the settled state.

Here we're chaining a new `.then()` because we want to work with the body of the response but as the comment in code anticipates we do not have a way to handle the error in it:
```js
fetch(API_URL + "films").then(
  response => {
    response.json().then(films => {
		// How can we handle an error here?
    })
  },
  error => {
    console.warn(error)
    output.innerText = ":(";
  }
);
```
We could add a new *onRejected* handler inside the `.then()` used for JSON but this will give us really hard problems< lucly we can rely on something different>
