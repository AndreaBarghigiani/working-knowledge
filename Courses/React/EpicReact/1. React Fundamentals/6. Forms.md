React does not change much at how JS interact with the DOM. We can attach a submit handler specifying a `onSubmit` prop, this gets called when form gets submitted and will send an event with `target`.

To get the `value` of an element exists many ways:
* Via their index: `event.target.elements[0]`
* Via the elements object by their `name` or `id` attribute: `event.target.elements.usernameInput.value`

Once you get the value you can store it in a variable, pass to a function or do whathever you want. It's just a value ðŸ˜‰

In React the default event system of the browser is substitute from the SyntheticEvent, generally we do not need to access to the 'original' event system of our browsers but in any case if we need to do so we can do it by accessing the `nativeEvent` from the event object you're using.
```js
function CustomComponent(){
	// Can be fired by any event handled by React, onSubmit or onChange for example
	function eventHandler( event ){
		console.log(event); // returns an SyntheticEvent object
		console.log(event.nativeEvent); // returns a standard event
	}
}
```
## Using refs
React allows us to access to a DOM element, in this example allows us to access the `value` of an input by using a Ref. Use a ref require us to import a new Hook from React itself, the Hook is [[useRef]].
```js
import {useRef} from React
```
Once we have this Hook in our component we can store it in a variable and assign it's `current` value declaring the special prop `ref` right inside our component.
```js
function CustomComponent(){
	const myRef = useRef();
	
	function handleSubmit(){
			// Access the ref value once assigned via the first render of the component
		const InputValue = myRef.current.value; // It is extremely important to use current
	}
	
	return (
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
			<input ref={myRef} />
		</form>
	)

}
```
Using a ref is not always adviced and we will discover why in next workshop.
## Validating input via `useState`
When we change a ref we **do not cause a re-render** of our application, this means that we could fire some side-effects, for example checking an input, only if we force in some way a new render of our application (that obviously means that we should store somewhere the value we're working with).

In React we can re-render a component if it's state is changed, in order to manage a state we use the [[React.useState()|useState]] Hook that we can use straight from React or via importing.
```js
// Both are valid syntax

// In this case we first import useState and then use in our component
import {useState} from React;
function CustomComponent(){
	const [state, setState] = useState(0);
}

// Here we use straight the Hook without importing it first
function CustomComponent(){
	const [state, setState] = React.useState(0);
}
```
[[React.useState()|useState]] is an Hook that returns an array, we destructure those values with the knowledge that the first value we get is the current state and the second one is a special function that allow us to update the value in the state and fire the re-render of our application.

In this example having a state that holds the input value comes handy because allows us to check the value of the input at any moment and by re-rendering the component React allows us to show an error message id needed and also disable the submit button.

```js
function UsernameForm({onSubmitUsername}) {
	const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)
  
	function handleSubmit(event) {
	  event.preventDefault()
	  onSubmitUsername(event.target.elements.usernameInput.value)
	}
  
	function handleChange(event) {
	  const {value} = event.target
	  const isLowerCase = value === value.toLowerCase()
	  setError(isLowerCase ? null : 'Username must be lower case')
	}
  
	return (
	  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
		<div>
		  <label htmlFor="usernameInput">Username:</label>
		  <input id="usernameInput" type="text" onChange={handleChange} />
		</div>
		<div role="alert" style={{color: 'red'}}>
		  {error}
		</div>
		<button disabled={Boolean(error)} type="submit">
		  Submit
		</button>
	  </form>
	)
}
```
