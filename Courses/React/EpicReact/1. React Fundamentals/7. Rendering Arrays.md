While rendering an array React needs a way to know which element of the array we are working on because if we do not give this reference it just guess for us.

In order to give this kind of information we need to pass a [[key prop|key]] prop that will help React identify the element in an unique way. Most of the time the data we're working with already have a kind of unique identifier, the ID, so let's just fake an answer from an API that gets a list of fruits from a database and use the ID stored to uniquely identify each element.

```js
const list = [
	{id: 'a', value: 'apple'},
	{id: 'o', value: 'orange'},
	{id: 'g', value: 'grape'},
  	{id: 'p', value: 'pear'},
]
const listUI = list.map(listItem => (
		<li key={listItem.id}>{listItem}</li> // Here I am using the ID of the item
	)
);
```
