Create a custom component mean create a function that returns a [[React Element]]. The first iteration on creating a custom component is via using the [[React.createElement()]] function and it could be as simple as:
```js
const customComponent = React.createElement( message, {children: 'Hello World'})

// Then you can insert it via JSX in the element that gets rendered
const element = (
	<div className='element'>
		{customComponent}
	</div>
)
```

Better yet, a custom component is generally a function with that **must** have a capital letter for its name. A simple example of it is:
```js
const Message = ({children}) => <div className="message">{children}</div>;
```
Now you can use it as a proper component inside your JSX:
```js
const element = (
   <div className="container">
     <Message>Hello World</Message>
     <Message>Goodbye World</Message>
   </div>
)
```
In this way the `children` get passed but we can do much more, for example we can pass multiple props in the component declaration:
```js
const Message = ({subject, greeting}) => <div className="message">{greeting}, {subject}</div>;
```
Now we can create the custom component and pass the different props like so:
```js
<Message greeting="Hello" subject="World" /> 
```
Since we can create custom components that get used by other developers it'll be a good idea to specify the kind of props that we want to use within the component. This means that if the component does not get the specific kind of props in the console we can show a proper messege that will help the developer that uses our component.

The first approach is to use the special property `propTypes` of the component and pass into it a function that will validate the props like so:
```js
Message.propTypes = {
	subject(props, propName){
		const type = typeof props[propName];
		if(type !== 'string' ){
			console.log('type', type);
			return new Error(`${propName} must be a string`)
		}
	},
	greeting(props, propName){
		const type = typeof props[propName];
		if(type !== 'string' ){
			console.log('type', type);
			return new Error(`${propName} must be a string`)
		}
	},
}
```
React will run all the code against our component but we can already see that there is a lot of duplicated code doing so and even if we can simplify the situation creating a `PropType` object that will have specific methods for validate the props:
```js
const PropTypes = {
  string(props, propName, componentName) {
	if (typeof props[propName] !== 'string') {
	  return new Error(
		`Hey, the component ${componentName} needs the prop ${propName} to be a string, but a ${typeof props[
		  propName
		]} was passed`,
	  )
	}
  },
}

Message.propTypes = {
  subject: PropTypes.string,
  greeting: PropTypes.string,
}
```
The react team already shares a nice npm package that will solve many of our problems, the `prop-types` one, and will let us also declare if a specific prop is also required:
```js
// Once the prop-types is installed and imported we can write something like
Message.propTypes = {
  subject: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  greeting: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}
```
### Special mention `<React.Fragment>`
React gives us a special component called *Fragment*, that we can call like [[React.Fragment]], that behaves as a container that we can use in JSX but that will not be rendered on the page.
