JSX is an HTML-like syntax that help us write easier [[React.createElement()]] and needs to be transpiled in order to be properly used.

In order to transpile this syntax generally we use Babel that will turn the JSX code into standard JavaScript/React code, a simple example of this is the following:
```js
// JSX
const ui = <h1 id="greeting">Hey there</h1>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ compiles to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

// JavaScript/React
const ui = React.createElement('h1', {id: 'greeting', children: 'Hey there'})
```

When you use JSX you've access to the *'best of both worlds'*, you can write your component as standard HTML but you can easily add some JS into the mix. This make easy to create complex component passing variables or entire functions to them. 

The basic sintax to tell the component that you're passing some JavaScript is by using `{}` like in the following example:
```js
// Interpolate example
const className = 'container'
const children = 'Hello World'
const element = <div className={className}>{children}</div>

// Resulting HTML
<div class="container">Hello World</div>
```
The transpiler will [[interpolate]] the content inside the curly braces, like the [[template literal|s]] does, and will use the value inside the variables to generate the HTML.

Since we're using JavaScript here we are not limited to passing single variables but we can also use the [[spread operator]] to fill the component with all values:
```js
const children = 'Hello World'
const className = 'container'
const props = {children, className}
const element = <div {...props} />
```
