The [[React.useEffect()]] is a built-in Hook that allows us to run some code when the component gets [[render|rendered]] (and re-rendered), it also accept a [[callback]] that React will call after the DOM has been updated:
```js
React.useEffect(() => {
  // this is where you can make HTTP requests or interact with browser APIs.
})
```
To better understand the flow of the when our functions get run in React have a look at: ![[hook-flow.png]]

### Extra Credit 2 - *effect dependencies*
[[React.useEffect()]] will be called for any render, the first and all the following, and this could not be that good for complex applications where a component gets re-rendered because it's parent has been re-render (this is how it works out of the box).

In order to avoid this we can specify a **second argument** to our [[React.useEffect()]], we can pass it an array that contains only the value that we want to monitor and run the callback function **when this value changes**.

For the scope of the exercise, since we are monitoring an input field storing it's value in [[localStorage]], we want to run the callback for this `useEffect` only when the value of `name` get's updated.

Remember that what we set into the dependency array it get's a [[shallow comparison]] so if use use object or arrays in here React will consider them different at each render because, even if values are the same, the reference to the object changes.

### Extra Credit 3 - *custom Hook*
We can create a [[custom Hook]] to wrap within a function the shared logic between components. What makes a custom Hook a custom Hook is:
* the fn name **must** start with `use`, this is just a best practice that if not followed will thrown an error
* it **must** use other Hooks in it and this is what accounts for 'shared logic'

Create a function is basic JavaScript stuff and something we do each single day, always remember that even if we're using React here a [[custom Hook]] is nothing less nothing more than a function.

So the first thing we do to solve our problem is to create the function that will contain the shared logic:
```js
function useLocalStorageState(){
	// Shared logic
}
```
Once we have the function we need to start thinking about the logic that we want to put in it. Our component will accept and use a value for `name` but use it as the name for the state declared in a custom component is not that generic, is it?

So we need to generalize the kind of data that the user of our custom Hook want to use.
```js
function useLocalStorageState(key, defaultValue = '') {
	const [state, setState] = React.useState(
		() => window.localStorage.getItem(key) || 
		defaultValue,
	)
	React.useEffect( () => {
		window.localStorage.setItem(key, state)
	}, [key, state] )

	return [ state, setState ]
}
```
As we can see this custom Hook `useLocalStorageState` gets two parameters:
* a `key` that will identify the value stored in `localStorage`
* a `defaultValue` that we initialize with an empty string and will identify the value that we need to store in `localStorage` for the specified string

Note that this custom Hook is behaving similarly to the built-in [[React.useState()|useState]] Hook since is returning an array where the first value is the actual value of the state and the second one is the updater fn.

Once this custom Hook is in place and imported within our component we can start to use it as follow:
```js
const [name, setName] = useLocalStorageState('name', 'Andrea')
```

### Extra credit 4: flexible localStorage hook
At the moment we store in `localStorage` only a primitive value like a string, a number or a boolean and that's fine since those can get converted quite easily in a string (the only type of value we can store in `localStorage`).

But if we want to allow our user to store arrays or objects we need to change the way we treat those data before to read or write them in `localStorage`, so we need to serialize the data when we save it into `localStorage` (we make it a string) and we need to deserialize it while reading.

In JavaScript we normally use `JSON.stringify()` to serialize and `JSON.parse()` to deserialize. Now that we know that we can change our custom component to 
```js
function useLocalStorageState(key, defaultValue = '') {

	const [state, setState] = React.useState(
		() => {
			const valueInLocalStorage = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
			if (valueInLocalStorage){
				return JSON.parse( valueInLocalStorage )
			}  
			return defaultValue
		})

	React.useEffect( () => {
		window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(state))
	}, [key, state] )

	return [ state, setState ]
}
```
**But** in doing so we're forcing the user of our custom Hook to rely on the JSON methods to de/serialize the data, we could do a better job if we give them the option to specify the kind of serialization that they would like to use.

To do so we add a new parameter `option` (an object) to our custom Hook and we create the methods `serialize` and `deserialize` defaulting them to the JSON methods.
```js
function useLocalStorageState(
	key, 
	defaultValue = '',
	{ serialize = JSON.stringify, deserialize = JSON.parse} = {} // Destructured options
) {
```

Moving on what if the `defaultValue` that our user is passing is something really expensive to get?

To preserve our app from running the expensive calculation at each render we can do like `useState` does and let the user pass a function, all we need to change in our [[custom Hook]] is the `return` of it:
```js
return typeof defaultValue === 'function' ? defaultValue() : defaultValue
```
The last missing piece of making this custom Hook future proof is to answer to the question: *what happen if the user changes the `key` of our value between re-renders?*

We should delete the old value of the `key` in `localStorage` and save the new one.

To do so we can reach for the [[React.useRef()|useRef]] build-in Hook that allow us to store a value between renders without firing a render if changed (like state does).

The first thing to do is to create the ref and store in it the current `key`.
```js
const prevKeyRef = React.useRef(key)
```
Once done that in our [[React.useEffect()|useEffect]] we check if the user is sending a new `key` and we will delete the old one:
```js
React.useEffect( () => {
	// Getting the value from ref
	const prevKey = prevKeyRef.current
	// If different just delete it
	if (prevKey !== key) {
		window.localStorage.removeItem(prevKey)
	}
	// Set the ref to the new key
	prevKeyRef.current = key
	...
```
