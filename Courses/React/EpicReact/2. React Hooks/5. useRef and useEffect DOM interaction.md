Always remember that when we write JSX like `<div>helloooo</div>` in React at the end of the day we **always** call the [[React.createElement()|createElement]] fn and for this reason we do not have direct access to that DOM element and that's because DOM nodes aren't created at all until the [[ReactDOM.render()]] method is called.

The render method that we use in React, the `return` statement that we use in a [[functional component]], is solely responsible to create and return the React Element.

So in order to get access to a DOM element in React we have to ask for it, or better yet [[React.useRef()|ref]] to it ðŸ˜‰

```js
function MyDiv() {
  const myDivRef = React.useRef()
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const myDiv = myDivRef.current
    // myDiv is the div DOM node!
    console.log(myDiv)
  }, [])
  return <div ref={myDivRef}>hi</div>
}
```
Most of the time we use [[React.useEffect()|useEffect]] because even React **can access a DOM element only once this has been mounted** and for this we use an `useEffect` with [[React.useEffect()#Running after mount the component - with an empty dependencies array|an empty array]] that will be run only once right after the mounting phase.

In this exercise we need to access to the DOM because the library that we use, `vanilla-tilt`, works directly with the DOM and for this reason we need to provide a way to the library to access this.

Basically we use [[React.useRef()|useRef]] any time we want keep a reference to something inside our app (could be a DOM node as this case or a [[React Element]]) without firing a re-render. This reference is mutable, means that it'll update its `current` property based on what happen to the reference.
