[[React.useState()]] is the first Hook that we encounter and accept a value that will be used to set the initial state of our custom component, this functions returns two values in an array:
1. the first value will be the value of the state at the current time we're calling it
2. the second value is a function that will let us update the state

In this case React returns those two values in a form of an array and generally we [[destruct]] those to make simplier to access and use them later.
```js
// Here I define a new state called state, to update it I'll use the setState fn
// and it's initial value will be 0
const [ state, setState ] = React.useState(0);
```
State can be defined as: data that changes over time.

When we update a state we tell React to re-render the component itself and this will help us to show the new value in the UI of our app. Basically re-render means that we tells React that something has changed and we want it to generate a new JSX based on the new values and this means re-execute the function that defines the new component.
