Lifting the state is a practice that is put to work when we need a specific value hold in a state to be shared between two or more components. In order to make it work we have to identify the closest shared parent component and lift there the state we want to share.

This means that if we have a component, for example `<Animal />`, that let us define a name for an animal that keeps it's value in local state as follow:
```js
function Animal( {animal, onAnimalChange }) {
	const [ animal, setAnimalName ] = React.useState('');
	return (
		<div>
		  <label htmlFor="animal">Favorite Animal: </label>
		  <input
			id="animal"
			value={animal}
			onChange={(event) => setAnimalName(event.target.value)}
		  />
		</div>
	)
}
```
If we have an `App` that has also a `<Display />` component that's a sibling of `<Animal />` and it also needs to access the animal name we can lift the state in the `<App />` component and pass it to both as a prop.
```js
function App() {
	const [animal, setAnimal] = React.useState('')
	return (
		<>
			<FavoriteAnimal animal={animal} onAnimalChange={ event => setAnimal(event.target.value)} />
			<Display animal={animal} />
		</>
	)
}
```
Now we've lifted the state and we pass it down to  `<Display />` and `<Animal />` as a prop, in `<Animal />` we pass as a prop also the fn in charge of update the state and we change the component as follow in order to work with the lifted state.
```js
function FavoriteAnimal( {animal, onAnimalChange }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="animal">Favorite Animal: </label>
      <input
        id="animal"
        value={animal}
        onChange={onAnimalChange}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```
### Colocating state
Colocate a state is the practice to move back a `useState` Hook within the component that uses it if there is no need to share the lifted state.

This means that we will remove the lifted state from the parent component and we will localize it inside the component that actually uses it. We do this because:
* it will improve the maintainability of our component (the state and update mechanism are right inside it)
* it will improve also the performances because when we will update the component where we colocate the state we do not need to render the parent component anymored
