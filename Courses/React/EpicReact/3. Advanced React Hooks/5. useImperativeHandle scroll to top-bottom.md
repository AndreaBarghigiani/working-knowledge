First thing we are reassign the `MessageDisplay` fn to create its `forwardRef` version:
```js
MessageDisplay = React.forwardRef(MessageDisplay);
```
This will give us a linting error, that we can ignore, but the most important thing is that now we can accept a second argument with our `MessageDisplay` that will let us handle the `ref` passed in the component.

Now that I have it I can assign to the `current` prop the methods that I am calling when I press the buttons. Let's check first why I need to do this checking what's going on in the `App` component:
```jsx
<div>
	<button onClick={scrollToTop}>scroll to top</button>
</div>
<MessagesDisplay ref={messageDisplayRef} messages={messages} />
<div>
	<button onClick={scrollToBottom}>scroll to bottom</button>
</div>
```
As you can see my JSX have two `onClick` event handler that will call different fns defined in the component like so:
```js
const scrollToTop = () => messageDisplayRef.current.scrollToTop()
const scrollToBottom = () => messageDisplayRef.current.scrollToBottom()
```
Now we can see the relationship with the `ref.current` and we need to implement them in our `MessageDisplay`, the component that will need to scroll based on the pressed button.
```js
ref.current = {
	scrollToTop,
	scrollToBottom,
}
```
Those fns are defined just below my definitions and will work on the `scrollToTop` property of the DOM element I am referring to.
```js
function scrollToTop() {
	containerRef.current.scrollTop = 0
}
function scrollToBottom() {
	containerRef.current.scrollTop = containerRef.current.scrollHeight
}
```
With this approach **we have a problem though**, we are directly manipulating a value during our render method. We could use [[React.useLayoutEffect()|useLayoutEffect]] as seen in the [[4. useLayoutEffect auto-scrolling textarea|previous lesson]] (because it is an Hook that fires before the DOM gets rendered) but the React team has created something better for us.

So instead to set the `ref` ourself we will leverage the `useImperativeHandle`.

With this Hook we can pass the `ref` we want to work with and as a second parameter we add a callback fn that will return the properties we want to add to it.
```js
React.useImperativeHandle(
	ref,
	() => ({
		scrollToTop,
		scrollToBottom,
}))
```
