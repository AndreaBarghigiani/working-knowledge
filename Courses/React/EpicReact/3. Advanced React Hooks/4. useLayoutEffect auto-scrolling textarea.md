[[React.useLayoutEffect()|useLayoutEffect]] is a really close Hook than [[React.useEffect()|useEffect]], they share the **same API** but they differ in when are fired.

Basically you have to use `useLayoutEffect` when your effect is mutating the DOM (via a DOM node ref) **_and_** the DOM mutation will change the appearance of the DOM node between the time that it is rendered and your effect mutates it. To better understand this it runs synchronously immediately after React has performed all DOM mutations.

> You use `useLayoutEffect` if the side effect that you are performing makes an observable change to the DOM that will require the browser to paint that update that you've made.

I am not going to add much here because the exercise is really simple, you just have to change `useEffect` with `useLayoutEffect`, and make more sense if you experience first hand what the difference are between the two.
