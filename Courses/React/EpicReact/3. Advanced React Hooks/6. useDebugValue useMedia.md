Let me begin with **finally** ðŸŽ‰
I am kinda of exited here because (finally) I now have an answer about a little thing that annoys me most when work with Hooks and that is the (IMHO) poor implementation inside the React Developer Tools ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)) of the browsers.

With class based component debug a state was easy, at the end of the day you get a `state` object for each component and you could look at all its `props` and values in it. 

With Hooks... Well you just have a bunch of same string without any reference to the meaning of the value, you have to check the value to try to understand what piece of state you're looking at.

The `useDebugValue` works **only on custom hooks** (not in a standard component) but is really useful because you should be able now to understand the power in creating your [[custom Hook]]. 

All you have to do is to call the `useDebugValue` inside your custom Hook like so:
```js
React.useDebugValue(`\`${query}\` => ${state}`);
```
And you will be able to see the debugging infomations improved from this:

to this:

Check the [source code](https://github.com/kentcdodds/advanced-react-hooks/blob/main/src/final/06.js#L6-L18) or the video to see how the custom Hook is created ðŸ˜‰

You can also pass a second argument that is a callback function to format the function, this fn exist only because we can postpone the calculation needed to display the value. If it is going to be some expensive calc better to move them away so the final user will not pay the price but if is something simple as creating a string with values we already have, like in our example, we can just pass it.
