We can style a component in many ways, if you use [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) you're free to `import` your stylesheets (even [[Sass]]) files right inside the component that uses it but there's a new movement that is getting used more and more and is [[**CSS-in-JS**]].

## Making a styled component with emotion

The implementation we will use is [emotion](https://emotion.sh) and gives us two ways to style our components while we are creating them:
```js
// Remember to import
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

// Template string
const Button = styled.button`
  color: turquoise;
`

// Object
const Button = styled.button({
  color: 'turquoise',
})
```
Both example will produce `<button className="css-1ueegjh">Hello</button>` when we will use the `<Button>` component inside our app. Notice how the styles we defined for the component are not applied inline but are injected in a CSS file created at runtime that contains the `css-1ueegjh` class name.

We can go even further and pass [[**props**]] to our component:
```js
// Template string
const Box = styled.div`
  color: ${props => (props.variant === 'tall' ? '150px' : '80px')};
`

// Object
const Box = styled.div(props => {
  return {
    height: props.variant === 'tall' ? 150 : 80,
  }
})
```
## Using emotion's `css` prop
Being able to create a component with a class is really useful in terms of reusability but in some cases we just need to change a couple of styles to address the current case. 
To solve those, instead to open our CSS files, we can use the special `css` prop that emotion gives to us.
**Remember:** *you have to import it with a special comment!!!*
```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import {jsx} from '@emotion/core'
import * as React from 'react'

// Template string
function SomeOtherComponent() {
  const color = 'darkgreen'

  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        background-color: hotpink;
        &:hover {
          color: ${color};
        }
      `}
    >
      This has a hotpink background.
    </div>
  )
}

// Object
function SomeComponent() {
  const color = 'darkgreen'

  return (
    <div
      css={{
        backgroundColor: 'hotpink',
        '&:hover': {
          color: color,
        },
      }}
    >
      This has a hotpink background.
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Exercise
We are request to apply some styles to the app, first is a `<Button>` component that will accept `variant` as prop in order to change the style from *primary* to *secondary*. I used a [[switch]] conditional since let me easily define also a standard style:
```js
const Button = styled.button(({variant}) => {
	let styles = {};

	switch (variant){
		case 'primary':
			styles.color = 'white';
			styles.backgroundColor = '#3f51b5';
			break;

		case 'secondary':
			styles.color = '#434449';
			styles.backgroundColor = '#f1f2f7';
			break;

		default:
			styles.color = 'red';
			styles.backgroundColor = 'green';
			break;
	}

	return {
		padding: '10px 15px',
		border: '0',
		lineHeight: '1',
		borderRadius: '3px',
		...styles
	}

})
```
I am using the object literal syntax in the `return` and I am using the [[spread operator]] because it let me easily expand the CSS values and rules contained in `styles`.

### Difference with Kent's code
My attempt has been to keep it all together and to use the function declaration for the `styled` but watching Kent lesson we discovered few more things.

First and foremost, you can pass as many arguments as you want in the `styled` fn and they will compose inside the general styles. But as CSS teaches **the last style will win**.

In my code example above I kept everything inside the same component declaration but we could be more elegant by separating the different styles inside an object and access to the specific style we are looking for with the bracket syntax of an object: `object[ key ]`.

```js
const buttonVariants = {
  primary: {
    background: '#3f51b5',
    color: 'white',
  },
  secondary: {
    background: '#f1f2f7',
    color: '#434449',
  },
}

const Button = styled.button(
  {
    ...
  },
  ({variant = 'primary'}) => buttonVariants[variant],
)
```

We set the default value for our `variant` at *primary* and we use the value stored in it to access the contained values inside the object.
Think that this is a lot more elegant since we don't need any conditional like `if` or `switch` as I done previously.

During the exercise we created other components with the `styled` solution but we needed to use the `css` special prop as well to customize come other DOM nodes. This example is really useful because it styles also the `div` contained:
```js
function LoginForm({onSubmit, submitButton}) {

  return (
    <form 
		css={{
			display: 'flex',
			flexDirection: 'column',
			alignItems: 'stretch',
			'> div': {
				margin: '10px auto',
				width: '100%',
				maxWidth: '300px',
			}
		}}
	>
      <FormGroup>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
        <Input id="username" />
      </FormGroup>
	  ...
```
I am sure you noticed the `> div` property we set in the object literal, so we just discovered that **we can style wrapped component too** using the `css` prop but I would like to point something else out:

**We are styling the `div` element that will be generated from the `FormGroup` one!!!**

This is kind of mindblowing for me, basically we define some styles for our `FormGroup` declaring it:
```js
const FormGroup = styled.div({
	display: 'flex',
	flexDirection: 'column'
})
```
And we can apply (or change) even more styles from its container thanks to the `css` prop! To be clear we expand the following properties:
```css
margin: '10px auto',
width: '100%',
maxWidth: '300px',
```
Because those are the ones defined inside the `> div` selector in the `css` prop that we pass to `<form>`.
