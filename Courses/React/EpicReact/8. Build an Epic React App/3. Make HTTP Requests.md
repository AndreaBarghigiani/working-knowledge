In this exercise we have to handle user searches and sending them to the server handling responses. 

Making calls to an API is generally done with [[window.fetch()]] that is able to take a path and *optionally* an configuration object but we will see how to abstract it in order to create a `client()` fn that'll help use make all the requests to the server.

In the first part of the exercise we have to wire up all the things, we will need four different parts of *"states"*.
```js
// Handles the state of the component, could be 'idle', 'loading', 'success' or 'error'
const [status, setStatus] = React.useState('idle')
// Stores the data we retrieve from the server
const [data, setData] = React.useState(null)
// The query the user has typed in the input
const [query, setQuery] = React.useState('')
// Boolean to define if user has already submitted something, useful for useEffect()
const [queried, setQueried] = React.useState(false)
```

We will track what the main component needs to hide/show with some variables:
```js
const isLoading = status === 'loading'
const isSuccess = status === 'success'
```
Those will help us in showing a loading icon, in case of `isLoading` is `true`, and to show the result of the query (the list of books) if the status passes to `success`, meaning `isSuccess` will be `true`.

To capture the data we need to use the `handleSearchSubmit` fn that has been already wired to the `onSubmit` event of the `form`.
```js
function handleSearchSubmit(event) {
	// Prevents the default behavior to not refresh page or update URL.
	event.preventDefault()
	// User now has submitted something, queried needs to be true.
	setQueried(true)
	// Pass the value to the state part that will use to make request.
	setQuery(event.target.elements.search.value)
}
```
Now that we have the value we need to send the query via an API request so we can have the answer response from the server, we can use [[window.fetch()]] to solve this:
```js
window.fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/books?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`)
	.then( response => response.json() )
	.then(responseData => {
    	setData(responseData)
    	setStatus('success')
  	})
```
Beside the width for the path we need to realize that we get all the interesting data from our request the second time we handle `then()` for our [[Promise]], for this reason we create a `client()` fn to make easier work with it.
```js
function client(endpoint, customConfig = {}) {
	// Make the default request to GET
  	const config = {
    	method: 'GET',
    	...customConfig,
  	}

	return window.fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/${endpoint}`, config)
		.then( response => response.json() )
}
```
Now that we declared this utility fn we can use it in our [[React.useEffect()|useEffect]] call once imported:
```js
React.useEffect(() => {
	// If user haven't already sent any query just return
	if (!queried) {
		return
	}
	// While running set status to loading
	setStatus('loading')
	client(`books?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`).then(
		responseData => {
			// Set data state to response
			setData(responseData)
			// Set status to success
			setStatus('success')
		}
	)
}, [query, queried])
```
## Extra Credit 1 - handle failed requests
Our `client()` assumes that everything will always go right but that's not the case in the reality, for this reason we need to handle the error in order to display a message with useful information.

When we make [[window.fetch()|fetch]] requests we will always have a response from the server, to understand if it was a success we can check `response.ok` and move accordingly.

To easily handle this kind of situation we will transform the Promise handling part, where we use `then()` to get the data, in an [[async/await syntax|async fn]]:
```js
function client(endpoint, customConfig = {}) {
  const config = {
    method: 'GET',
    ...customConfig,
  }

  return window
    .fetch(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/${endpoint}`, config)
    .then( async response => {
		// With an async fn we can await the response.
		const data = await response.json();
		if(response.ok){
			// Simply return data.
			return data;
		} else {
			// Return a reject with data.
			return Promise.reject(data)
		}
	})
}
```
Now that we *force* our `client()` fn to return us a rejected Promise we can change our component to make it handle also the error case. In order to do so we need to add a new state `error` that will contain the error object of our query and also the `isError` boolean that will help use change our UI based on it's presence.
```js
const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)
const isError = status === 'error'
```
Once we have this data to work with the first step is change our [[React.useEffect()|useEffect]] to make it store the error value if needed:
```js
React.useEffect(() => {
	
	/* Same as before ... */
	client(`books?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`).then(responseData => {
		setData(responseData)
		setStatus('success')
	}, errorData => {
		// We set the state error with the data returned from reject()
		setError(errorData);
		// Set the state status to error, so it'll change isError
		setStatus('error')
	})
}, [query, queried])
```
Now that we update the needed states for our component we only miss to change some parts of our return to handle the situation:
```js
return (
	<div css={{/* Styles */}}>
		<form onSubmit={handleSearchSubmit}>
		{ /* Same as before inside the form... */ }
        <Tooltip label="Search Books">
          <label htmlFor="search">
            <button type="submit" css={{ /* Styles */ }}>
              {isLoading ? 
				<Spinner /> : 
				  isError ? // Here we andle the error
				    <FaTimes aria-label='Error' css={{ color: colors.danger}} /> : 
					<FaSearch aria-label="search" />
			  }
            </button>
          </label>
        </Tooltip>
      </form>

	  { isError ? (
		<div css={{color: colors.danger}}>
			<p>There was an error:</p>
			<pre>{error.message}</pre>
		</div>
	  ) : null }

	  { /* Same as before for success... */ }
	</div>
)
```
Now we have all the code that let us handle the error when we face one, just remember to import all the colors that are stored in `styles/colors.js` as follows:
```js
import * as colors from './styles/colors';
```
## Extra Credit 2: use the `useAsync` hook
This exercise is pretty simple, all that is ask from us is to change our code in order to use the `useAsync` [[custom Hook]]. Thanks to this our code looks a lot more simpler and we have all the data that we need to handle our UI right from this Hook:
```js
function DiscoverBooksScreen() {
  // The new custom Hook handles all the cases and previous states
  const {data, error, run, isLoading, isError, isSuccess} = useAsync()
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState()
  const [queried, setQueried] = React.useState(false)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!queried) {
      return
    }
	// We just need to fire the function that will return the promise
    run(client(`books?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`))
  }, [query, queried, run])
  /** Everything will stay the same */
```
The code inside the `useAsync` custom Hook is pretty complex and understand it is out of the scope of this lesson but if you feel like you need to dig deeper you always can [right inside the file](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani/bookshelf/blob/exercises/03-data-fetching/src/utils/hooks.js#L21-L82).
