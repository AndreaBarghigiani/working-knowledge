The exercise goes pretty straight, [[ReactDOM.render()|render]] a React app is always the same. 

We take a component and we render it via `ReactDOM.render()`, just to show you some code this is the summary:
```js
// Internal deps, needed to make it work
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

// Define the component
function App() {
	return (
		// This is the JSX I want to return
		// REMEMBER: JSX in just a series of React.createElement()
	)
}

// Now I render the <App /> component inside #root that I find in the index.html file
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```
This is the base, exercise required us to use some already made components to render a simple login page.

Things got more interesting while working on extra credits.

### Extra credit 1 - add a modal on click
The modal component that has been suggested is the `Dialog` from the [Reach UI](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/tree/main/packages/dialog) library. 
All we need to do is to use the `Dialog` component and decide if we want to show/hide it by passing to it a `boolean` as `isOpen` prop. Basic usage:
```js
<Dialog isOpen={ true }>
	<!-- You see me because isOpen is true -->
</Dialog>

<Dialog isOpen={ false }>
	<!-- You don't see me because isOpen is false -->
</Dialog>
```
The great idea is to treat the component state like a state machine, based on the value of the state we decide which modal box to show. As suggested the possible states are:
* `none` - default state that will hide any modal
* `login` - modal popup for the login click
* `register` - modal popup for the register click

At this point we need just one state and we can change its value based on click:
```js
function App() {
	const [ openModal, setOpenModal] = React.useState('none');

	return (
		<>
			<!-- Handling cliicks -->
			<button onClick={ () => setOpenModal('login') }>Login</button>
			<button onClick={ () => setOpenModal('register') }>Register</button>
			
			<!-- Handling modal display -->
			<Dialog isOpen={ openModal === 'login' }>
				<button onClick={ /* Close fn*/ } >x</button>
				<p>Content to show</p>
			</Dialog>
			<Dialog isOpen={ openModal === 'register' }>
				<button onClick={ /* Close fn*/ } >x</button>
				<p>Content to show</p>
			</Dialog>
		</>
	)
}
```
The concept is really simple but most of the time we get wrapped in complex ideas ðŸ˜Š
### Extra credit 2 - create a LoginForm
Here's mostly a simple example on how to make a new component with minor event handling functions. I did it with the following code but the tricky part I found is that I didn't know where to `preventDefault` the load of the page.
```js
function LoginForm({onSubmit, buttonText}) {
	const [ username, setUsername ] = React.useState('');
	const [ password, setPassword ] = React.useState('');

	return (
		<form onSubmit={ onSubmit }>
			<label for='username'>Username</label>
			<input value={ username } onChange={ (e) => setUsername(e.target.value) } />
			<label for='password'>Password</label>
			<input value={ password } onChange={ (e) => setPassword(e.target.value) } />
			<button>{ buttonText }</button>
		</form>
	)
}
```
Solution for this was simple, I just need to create an `handleSubmit` to handle in it the event obj (that let's me call the `preventDefault`) and call the `onSubmit` fn passed via props inside it.

How to translate it into code:
```js
function handleSubmit(e){
	e.preventDefault();
	onSubmit( [username, password] ); // You can pass what you want
}

return (
	<form onSubmit={ handleSubmit }>
```

Here's the Kent's approach in solving this, mayor differences is that he's **not using state at all** in the component, uses the event object (that we already have) to take values from it and this actually seems to be the best approach for what we need to realize.

We use plain JavaScript for something simple.
```js
function LoginForm({onSubmit, buttonText}) {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
	// Destructs current form values from elements
    const {username, password} = event.target.elements
	
	// Send new values via fn passed with props
    onSubmit({
      username: username.value,
      password: password.value,
    })
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
        <input id="username" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input id="password" type="password" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button type="submit">{buttonText}</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  )
}
```
