Components that work together to form a complete UI, think of it like `select` and `option` HTML elements. Taken each separately are pretty useless but using them together let use easily create an UI where the user can select a value from a list.

In React terms the `select` is responsable to handle the state of the component that gets changed with the `option` value.

In basic terms the compound components pattern let us write more readable component that will help out the user of our code. Let's take the following example from the exercise:
```js
<Toggle
	isOn={'The button is on'}
	isOff={'The button is on'}
	onClick={ toggle }
/>
```
This is my own take on the original code for the exercise that looks as follow:
```js
<Toggle>
	<ToggleOn>The button is on</ToggleOn>
	<ToggleOff>The button is off</ToggleOff>
	<ToggleButton />
</Toggle>
```
Which one do you prefer? 

The example is really simple and probably you do not mind pass some props into your component but the basic idea of compound components is that will make easier to change and adapt the component that you're creating based on the requirements of it.

I've seen many times components that simply have too many props, it even exists a term for it and it's *apropcalypse* (oh boy... there even a [pretty popular hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/apropcalypse) for it). 

As Michael Jackson states in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XaXKiXtNjw) the `children` prop is the key for the composition of your components.

So in order to make complex use of custom props we can leverage [[React.Children]] and [[React.cloneElement]] to `map` all the children of `Toggle` and pass to the cloned elements the piece of state that we care about.

### Be aware of standard DOM elements!
In the extra credit we're asked to add a simple `span` into our `Toggle` component. From an UI perspective everything was working fine but if you inspect the console you'll notice a nasty error:
![[DOM-not-supported-props.png]]

Basically this happens because in our `React.cloneElement` we are passing the `on` and `toggle` as props to **any children** of `Toggle`. This works well when the children are React components (they accept any kind of prop) but for DOM elements this is no good because the browser will try to render the following `span`:
```js
<span on toggle="???">Hello</span>
```
This is my own representation of what the browser will try to do, fortunately for us React already protect ourselves injecting an empty `span` but still alert us in the console to improve the situation.

Since DOM elements are just strings to the eyes of React my take on it has been the following:
```js
function Toggle(props) {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)

  return React.Children.map(
		props.children, child => {
				return typeof child.type === 'string'
					? child
					: React.cloneElement( child, { on, toggle });
		})
}
```
From Kent's video there is a nice touch though, basically we could create an array of allowed components that will get access to the state like so:
```js
const allowedTypes = [ToggleOn, ToggleOff, ToggleButton];

function Toggle({children}) {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)
  return React.Children.map(children, child => {
  		if(allowedTypes.includes(child.type)){
			return React.cloneElement(child, {on,toggle})
		}
		return child;
  })
}
```
