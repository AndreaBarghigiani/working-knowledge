The limit that we encounter in the previous exercise was that we force the user of our components to use them at the first level, the user is not allowed to wrap one of the children components in other because we check the `props.children` in order to pass down the state value.

The moment that you wrap one of your components within something else you brake the application because now the component is not able to access the state of the anchestor.

To solve this we need to use [[React.useContext|useContext]].

# Exercise
The exercise wasn't that difficult tbh, Kody was really helpful and all you have to do in order to solve it is to create your `ToggleContext` with a `value` that contains the state `on` and the setter fn `toggle`. Passing down it to your components and you're good to go.

Probably the most interesting part of all the exercise is that we automatically wrap all the `children` of the main `Toggle` component without force the user to add it via code:
```js
function Toggle({children}) {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)

	const value = { on, toggle };
	return <ToggleContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</ToggleContext.Provider>
}
```

### Extra Credit 1
Beside the creation of a custom Hook that help us give a comprehensive error message to the user, we already done this in [[3. useContext simple Counter]] there has been the ability to give to our `Context` a better name that will help us debugging our application with the React Dev Tools:
```js
const ToggleContext = React.createContext();
ToggleContext.displayName = 'ToggleContext';
```
With this while debugging instead of reading `Context.Provider` we will be able to see `ToggleContext.Provider` ðŸ˜‰
