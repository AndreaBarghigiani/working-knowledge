The base idea of this lesson is to implement an *inversion of control* where user of our component can pass, if they want, a new reducer to handle how we update the state of our component.

This is trivial, or almost impossible, to do with a simple `useState` because in that case is the updater function that is in charge on how the state gets updated.

Using `useReducer`, instead, allows us to give the ability to our end user to totally override how we update the state for special use cases.
# Exercise
The first part of the exercise is incredibly simple, all you have to do is to follow Kody's instructions and use all the code that is already written for you that is able to customize the behaviour of the component.

All that we have to do is to transform the `useToggle` custom hook from this:
```js
function useToggle({initialOn = false} = {}) {
  const {current: initialState} = React.useRef({on: initialOn})
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(toggleReducer, initialState)
```
into this:
```js
function useToggle({reducer = toggleReducer, initialOn = false} = {}) {
  const {current: initialState} = React.useRef({on: initialOn})
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState)
```
Basically now we pass `toogleReducer`, the reducer fn created in our component, as a default and we allow the user of the component to override the standard behaviour by passing it's own `reducer`.

This is the default `toggleReducer`:
```js
function toggleReducer(state, {type, initialState}) {
  switch (type) {
    case 'toggle': {
      return {on: !state.on}
    }
    case 'reset': {
      return initialState
    }
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported type: ${type}`)
    }
  }
}
```
As you can see nothing fancy here. We deconstruct the `action` right inside of the parentesis and we apply our changes based on the `type`.

Now when our user want's to customize how the `on` state gets changed he can do it by creating it's own `toggleStateReducer`:
```js
function toggleStateReducer(state, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 'toggle': {
			if (clickedTooMuch) {
				return {on: state.on}
			}
			return {on: !state.on}
		}
		case 'reset': {
			return {on: false}
		}
		default: {
			throw new Error(`Unsupported type: ${action.type}`)
		}
	}
}

const {on, getTogglerProps, getResetterProps} = useToggle({
	reducer: toggleStateReducer,
})
```

## Extra Credit 
### ðŸ’¯ default state reducer
The solution to this exercise is to just export both the `useToggle` custom hook **and** the reducer fn `toggleReducer` because in this case our user could import the reducer and not worry to rewrite all of it. 

Basically instead to recreate the entire reducer:
```js
function toggleStateReducer(state, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 'toggle': {
			if (clickedTooMuch) { // <- We care only about this
				return {on: state.on}0
			}
			return {on: !state.on}
		}
		case 'reset': {
			return {on: false}
		}
		default: {
			throw new Error(`Unsupported type: ${action.type}`)
		}
	}
}

const {on, getTogglerProps, getResetterProps} = useToggle({
	reducer: toggleStateReducer,
})
```

We can just check for the case we want to override the standard behaviour and let `toggleReducer` handle the rest:
```js
function toggleStateReducer(state, action) {
	if( action.type === 'toggle' && clickedTooMuch ){
		return  { on: state.on }
	}

	return  toggleReducer(state, action);
}
```
As you can see now, we only override the standard behaviour if `action.type` is `toggle` **and** we `clickedTooMuch`.
### ðŸ’¯ state reducer action types
This extra credit asks us to simply create an `actionTypes` object that contains all of our types, doing so will help our end user not making typos and the IDE is able to give autocomplete suggestions.

Basically all we have to do is create: 
```js
const actionTypes = {
	toggle: 'toggle',
	reset: 'reset',
}
```

And everywhere we have `'toggle'` change it with `actionTypes.toggle` and where we have `'reset'` change it with `actionTypes.reset`.
> Remember that you have to **export** `actionTypes` from where you define it because, if not, your user will not be able to use it ðŸ˜‰
