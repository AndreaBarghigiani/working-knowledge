This kind of pattern is going to help the user of our code, that in our case is the component that's using our [[context]], especially when we want to offer some kind of helper function to handle the state of the `context` itself.

```js
const CounterContext = React.createContext()

function CounterProvider({step = 1, initialCount = 0, ...props}) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(
    (state, action) => {
      const change = action.step ?? step
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment': {
          return {...state, count: state.count + change}
        }
        case 'decrement': {
          return {...state, count: state.count - change}
        }
        default: {
          throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action.type}`)
        }
      }
    },
    {count: initialCount},
  )

  const value = [state, dispatch]
  return <CounterContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
}
```

In the example from the explanation of the lesson we have handle the state of our `context` from [[React.useReducer()|useReducer]], doing so will require us to pass also the `dispatch` fn that is listening to the actions that will modify the state.

The problem is that **the user does not know anything about our actions** or to better phrase the user will need to check the declaration of our `context` to see which kind of action we are looking for in order to update the state.

We could try to add the specific `dispatch` fn right inside the `context` like so:
```js
const CounterContext = React.createContext()

function CounterProvider({step = 1, initialCount = 0, ...props}) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(
	//Same reducer as before
  )
 
  // Creating helper functions and pass them via value
  const increment = React.useCallback(() => dispatch({type: 'increment'}), [
  	dispatch,
  ]);
  const decrement = React.useCallback(() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'}), [
	  dispatch,
  ]);
  
  const value = {state, increment, decrement}
  return <CounterContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
}

// --- How user will use this
const {state, increment, decrement} = useCounter()
```
The downside of this approach is that we're adding our methods **in each instance of the object**, meaning that we will bring those helper methods everywhere with us even when we do not need them.

Best approach would be to create utility fns separately and import them as additional modules that our users can import in specific point of the application.
```js
const CounterContext = React.createContext()

function CounterProvider({step = 1, initialCount = 0, ...props}) {
  // Same provider as before
}

function useCounter() {
  const context = React.useContext(CounterContext)
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error(`useCounter must be used within a CounterProvider`)
  }
  return context
}

// dispatch is passed as argument of the fn, not related to the one in Provider
const increment = dispatch => dispatch({type: 'increment'})
const decrement = dispatch => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})

// Here I am also exporting the utility fns
export {CounterProvider, useCounter, increment, decrement}

// --- How user will use this
import {useCounter, increment, decrement} from 'context/counter'

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useCounter()
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Current Count: {state.count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => decrement(dispatch)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => increment(dispatch)}>+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
