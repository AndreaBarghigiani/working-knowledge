A block is just a bunch of code within a `do` and `end`. The gotcha is that you can not run this code alone we need to attach to a method call, generally speaking you do this by prepending a method to the block, like in the following example:
```ruby
3.times do
	puts "Echo!"
end
```
Even if the block looks like a method parameter it is not and we can make it explicit by adding parenthesis:
```ruby
3.times() do
	puts "Echo!"
end
```
As you can see the block came after the parenthesis, the place where the method is looking for them.

Generally speaking the `do end` block is adviced for multiline chunck of code, if you have a one liner we can just replace them with curly braces:
```ruby
3.times() { puts "Echo!!" }
```

The `times` method, as many others, is able to pass the iteration number to the block and we can let it use defining it as a **block parameter**. A block parameter is delimited by the pipe `|`:
```ruby
3.times do |number|
	puts "#{number} Echo!"
end
```
And in a one liner the use of the block parameters looks like this:
```ruby
3.times { |n| puts "#{n} Echo!" }
```

Variables defined inside a block are considered **local variable**, meaning their value is not accessible outside the block but if the variable is first declared outside the block we can change it value and make accessible.

For example let's populate an array with some code in a block:
```ruby
counting = []
1.upto(10) { |n| counting << n }
puts counting
```
Basically we need to declare the array **outside** the block in order to persist the data we want to insert. This obviously is valid for **any** value, the exception to the rule is that if both variables have the **same name** the *outside variale* keep it's original value.
```ruby
number = 100
3.times do |number|
	puts number # Prints 0,1,2
end
puts number # Prints 100
```
In case you really need to use the same name for variables but you want to keep the value of the original one you just need to pass a new *block parameter* in order to not override it.
```ruby
number = 100
temp = 36
3.times do |number, temp|
	temp = 12
	# Code 
end
puts temp # Prints 36
```
