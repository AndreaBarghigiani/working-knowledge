We want the username to be *unique*, to be *present* and to be at least 3 characters long.

Back into our `User` model all we need to do is to place this line of validations:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :username, presence: true, uniqueness: true, length: {minimum: 3, maximum: 50}
end
```
Now we can test this in our console just to see how Rails it will behave:
```ruby
> user = User.new(username: "aa", email: "aa@email.com")
> user.valid?
=> false
```
> **Note** If you want to test a model instance before to `save` it to the database you can check it's validity with the `valid?` method.

Fast forward we create the following validations to be sure that both username and password are unique and on top of that we inserted a regex to check the validity of the email:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :username, presence: true,
					uniqueness: {case_sensitive: false},
					length: {minimum: 3, maximum: 50}
  VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z\d\-]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i
  validates :email, presence: true,
					uniqueness: true,
					length: {maximum: 105},
					format: {with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX}
end
```
