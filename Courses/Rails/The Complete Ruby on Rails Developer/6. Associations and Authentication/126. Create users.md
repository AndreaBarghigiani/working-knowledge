In order to have associations we need to create a new table, in this section we create a new table for our users. To get more confident with the Rails code we generate a migration file: `bin/rails g migration create_users`

This will create the following migration file that's basically empty, except for the fact that if we run `bin/rails db:migrate` we'll have a new `users` table.
```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :users, id: :uuid do |t|

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

^065633

So we add the two strings for username and email, we'll worry about password later
```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :users, id: :uuid do |t|
	  t.string :username
	  t.string :email
		
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```
Now that we add the barebones information about a user we can run the migration, remember `bin/rails db:migrate`, but since Rails does not know about this table yet we have to create our model for it:
```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
end
```
And now we can start to test with all the CRUD methods that Rails has created for use as already saw in previous lessons.
