# Read
Before to be able to read an entry from the database you have to `find` it. 
This is another cool feature of the Rails modules, you do not have to define a `find` method for it you just have to use it because you inherit from the `ApplicationRecord` class.

Following the previous examples where we created the `articles` table and the `Article` model to handle it we can find a specific entry providing it's `id`:
`Article.find(id)`
> Remember that with our setup where we use `uuid` to generate the `id`s it will always be a `string` and not an integer.

You can also easily find the first an last entry of a table with the corresponding methods:
```ruby
Article.first # Retrieves the first entry
Article.last # Retrieves the last entry
```
All those methods just return the entry of the database, if you want to do something with it remember to store it in a variable.

# Update
Once you have the entry stored in a variable you can use all the *setter* and *getter* already defined. While you can change the values stored in the variable **remember** that you are not saving them in the database. In order to do so you have to `save`.
```ruby
article = Article.find(2)
article.title = "My changed second title" # Not yet saved in the database
article.save # This updates the record in the database
```

# Delete
Once you have found a record and stored it in the database you can delete the record with the `destroy` method:
```ruby
last_article = Article.last
last_article.destroy # Removes the record from the database
```
