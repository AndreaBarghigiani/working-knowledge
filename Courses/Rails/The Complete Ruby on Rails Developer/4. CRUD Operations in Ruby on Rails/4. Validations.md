We can set our validations right in our model, this allow us to be able to require, limit or in any way handle the kind of data we are storing in our database.

For example our `Article` model is accepting all kind of data, even if we provide empty values a new record is created. This is no good and to limit this we can write our validation.
```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :description, presence: true
end
```
Now that we have those validations in place we can be sure that when we try to save an empty record we get our errors back and the value is not get stored in the database:
```ruby
> article = Article.new
=> #<Article:0x00005595c680c968 id: nil, title: nil, description: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>

> article.save
=> false

> article.errors.full_messages
=> ["Title can't be blank", "Description can't be blank"]
```
As you can see when we try to `save` the record instead of getting the general response with all the data stored we get `false`. The `errors` holds an object with all the information regarding why our entry is not accepted but the more human readable way is to show the `full_messages`, an array that we can loop through to discover what happen.

Validations are not only available for the presence of a field, we can do much more with them! If you want to have a deep dive into it [check the guide on the Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html), meanwhile here's how to set a min length for the title and description:
```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true, length: { minimum: 6, maximum: 100 }
  validates :description, presence: true, length: { minimum: 10, maximum: 300 }
end
```
