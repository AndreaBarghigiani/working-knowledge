As for previous sections we first need to expose the `destroy` route and since this is the last route that `resources :articles` will expose we can just remove the `only [...]` that will limit the routes exposed.

> Just be aware that using only `resources :articles` will expose also all the RESTful routes of our articles

# Create the `destroy` link
As already happen for the `create` and `update` actions in these cases we do not have a specific URL or a path, Rails calls them automatically once the users sends the action with the connected view.

Before to see the code of `destroy` we need to understand that most of the time we do not have a dedicated view to allow the user to delete something, generally it's a simple link with a confirmation message.

So we will first create a `link_to` in the views that will show the single article and their list, I leave to you to find the best place to put the following code:
```ruby
<%= link_to 'Delete',
  article_path(article),
  class: "your-classes",
  method: "delete",
  data: {confirm: 'Are you sure?'}
%>
```
Since the URL that will be generated will be the same as the one used to `#show` or `#update` we need to tell to the server which kind of request we are making, this is done via the `method: "delete"` attribute.

Since we do not want that our user could accidentally click on the delete action we also implement a confirmation modal that **Rails generate for us** when we set `data: {confirm: 'Are you sure?'}` into our `link_to`.

# Create the `destroy` action
Now that we know how to empower our users with a link able to delete the resource, let's check what we need to create in our controller:
```ruby
# articles_controller.rb
def destroy
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  if @article.destroy
    flash[:notice] = "The article <strong>#{@article.title}</strong> has been deleted successfully"
    redirect_to articles_path
  else
    redirect_to @article
  end
end
```
The code is really similar to the one we wrote for the `create` and `update` actions, we find the `Article` we're working with thanks to `params[:id]` and we call the `destroy` method (provided by the Model).

In case of success we set a [[92. Validation and flash messages|flash message]] and redirect the user to the `index` view thanks to `redirect_to articles_path` otherwise we show the `show` view and let the errors talk for themselves.
