I'll be using `simple_form` here since seems to be the company preferred gem.
As per README to install this gem you just need to:
```ruby
# In Gemfile
gem 'simple_form'

# In console
bundle install
bin/rails g simple_form:install
```

Now let's continue creating the form for our article.

Set the new routes `new` and `create` in the `routes.rb`:
```ruby
# routes.rb
resources :articles, only: [:show, :index, :new, :create]
```

If you check with `bin/rails routes` you'll notice that `new` will add a new path (`/articles/new`) while `create` will use the same path as `index` but for a POST request:
```bash
$ bin/rails routes
     Prefix Verb URI Pattern             Controller#Action
       root GET  /                       pages#index
 components GET  /components(.:format)   pages#components
   articles GET  /articles(.:format)     articles#index
            POST /articles(.:format)     articles#create
new_article GET  /articles/new(.:format) articles#new
    article GET  /articles/:id(.:format) articles#show
```

Once created the two new actions in `articles_controller.rb` the only view we need to create is `new.html.erb`.
# Create the form
Once Simple Form is set up and ready to go we just need to expose the model from the controller and create the relative form:
```ruby
# articles_controller.rb

class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  # Other code
	
  def new
	# Pass @article instance variable
    @article = Article.new
  end
  
  # Other code
end

# new.html.erb
<% defaults = {
	wrapper_html: { class: 'flex flex-col mb-3' },
}%>
<%= simple_form_for @article, defaults: defaults, html: {class: "max-w-md"} do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :title %>
  <%= f.input :description %>
  <%= f.button :submit, class: "bg-blue-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded cursor-pointer" %>
<% end %>
```
Using `simple_form` helps a lot here reducing the amount of code needed for the form, now that the form is able to capture the data it's time to take care of the `create` action.

### Check if the data gets passed
Beside using `byebug` if you need to quickly check if the data get passed are correct you can quickly add to the `create` action the following code:
```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  # Other code

  def create
    render plain: params[:article] # Show in plain text what we send via form
  end
end
```
