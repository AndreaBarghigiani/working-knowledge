As already happen for the article creation, where we use a combination of `new` and `create` actions inside our controller, even now we will be using a combination of `edit` and `update` actions where the first is in charge of loading the view and pass to it the needed information about the article we'll be editing and the latter will handle the updating process behind the scenes to store the changes in the database.

# Exposing routes
The first step we need to take is to expose our routes. Let's open `routes.rb` and change it like so:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'pages#index'

  resources :articles, only: [:show, :index, :new, :create, :edit, :update]
end
```
As you already know we can check that everything is working fine with `bin/rails routes`.

# Generating the form
The form is really similar to the one that we use in `new.html.erb` but it needs to be populated with the current information that are stored in the database, so we need to work with the article model right away.

We will be working with the model because when Rails see that we're working with it and will have an `id` will fetch automatically all the data stored in it.

Since we use `simple_form` we are already using the model even in the `new.html.erb` view, so all that we have to do is to create the instance variable that we will be using in `edit.html.erb`
```ruby
# articles_controller.rb
def edit
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
end
```
Just adding this single line to our `edit` action we're able to prefill the form.

# Updating the article
Now that we show the correct information it's time to handle the update process. Since we're updating an existing article the first thing I need to do is to find it:
```ruby
# articles_controller.rb
def update
	@article = Article.find(params[:id])
end
```
Now that we have it we just need to updated it with the values in the form
```ruby
# articles_controller.rb
def update
	@article = Article.find(params[:id])
	@article.update(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :description))
end
```
As we did for the `create` action we need to whitelist the fields that our form will send but we still need to show a success message or the errors to our users.

As we did in the previous lesson, we just need to check that everything is fine and respond accordingly:
```ruby
# articles_controller.rb
def update
	@article = Article.find(params[:id])
	if @article.update(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :description))
		flash[:notice] = "Article was updated successfully"
		redirect_to @article
	else 
		render 'edit'
	end
end
```
