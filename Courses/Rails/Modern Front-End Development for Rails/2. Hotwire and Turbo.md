Learn hot to add interactivity to your pages writing almost zero JavaScript.
# The Hotwire Way
Hotwire is a set of tools that helps you send *HTML over the wire*, you don't have to deal with JSON or AJAX at all, with those you write as less JavaScript as possible and generally changes in the UI are driven toggling classes.

The base idea is:
* The server communicates with the client by sending rendered HTML, not raw data. This HTML response may contain some metadata about where to put it when it arrives.
* Any business logic the application might need should be on the server, not on the client.
* Specific client logic should be limited only to interface items that the server won’t care about.
* Where possible, client logic should be handled through the addition and removal of CSS classes. Doing so allows for a lot of client logic to be written in a generic manner.

Basically the server is the source of truth and this (should) help preventing duplicate the logic between the client and the server.

This kind of approach works really well if you leverage the partial-view files, especially if you use the [ActiveRecord naming convention](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#naming-partials).
# Installing Turbo
Unless you came from an old Rails app that you have to maintain you can skip this part of the book, the code sample already contains what you need and all the changes happen in the background.
# What is Turbo Drive?
Turbo Drive, previously known as Turbolinks, captures every clicked link or form submission, receives the response in the background, extract the `body` of the request and replaces the entire `body` of the page with the new response.

The downside of this approach is that the `load` event, that many JavaScript libraries depend on, is not fired.

The solution is use Turbo Frame and Turbo Streams.
# Adding Interactivity with Turbo Frames
Turbo Frames behaves like Turbo Drive but the main difference is that the latter **will send the entire body** while with a frame we send just a little piece of HTML.

A Turbo Frame is a custom HTML tag, `<turbo-frame>`, that you can also generate with the helper function `turbo_frame_tag`.

As per Drive, Turbo Frame any click or a form submission will capture the server response. It'll look at the response looking for a Turbo Frame that has the same ID and it'll replace just that part of the page.

So when you want to create a Turbo Frame you need to wrap **two elements**, the first is the one that'll fire the capture and the second one is the partial that we want to use. In the example used in the book we have a row of a concert (the one that fires the capture) and we want to show the edit form when the user clicks the *Edit* button.

In order to make this connection we wrap the entire concert and the entire form, each of them are partials btw, with `turbo_frame_tag(dom_id(concert))`. We use `dom_id()` because is able to generate for us a standard `id` from the `concert` informations. 

When a Turbo Frame sees a matching `id` between the request and the response, it'll simply replace the existing Turbo Frame with the incoming content.

When working with a Turbo Frame a nice touch is to **edit the action that handles the response**, in the book the example points to the `update`. To do so we change the `redirect_to` method that we generally use after a succesful update with a standard `render(@concert)`.

> ***Note:*** as you can see in this case the `render` is not used to call an action (that by default will render a view with the same name) but we pass to it the instance variable that holds all the current object. In doing so we're leveraging the (already mentioned) [ActiveRecord naming convention](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#naming-partials) that allow us to load a partial instead of an entire view.

We could keep the `update` action untouched because Rails is smart enough to take only the `<turbo-frame>` that has the same ID and will stop the action from rendering the layout but for performance reason is better to send as little HTML as needed, this it'll be helpful even from the database point of view since we will ask only for the data we need to display.

> ***Troubleshooting:*** If the incoming response does not contain a matching Turbo Frame, the existing Turbo Frame is replaced with blank contents. When this happen you can check the browser console, the Rails log or the Network tab to investigate on what is happening.

# Navigating Outside a Turbo Frame
Our previous changes get us a weird problem: **links inside a Turbo Frame don't work and gives unexpected results**.

If we click on a concert, that supposely should send us to the single concert page, the concert disappears from the list (*hint:* have a look at the Troubleshooting section above ☝️) and clicking on the *Make Favorite* button updates only the concert row but not the Favorite section above.

Both of those are caused by the same problem: **the link are inside the Turbo Frame but we try to change parts of the page that are outside**.

We can handle this in two ways:
* add a `target` attribute to our `<turbo-frame>` (or `target:` if you use the helper fn) that will set the default target for the frame. **No good** because this will change the behavior of all links in the frame redrawing the target frame.
* use the `data-turbo-frame` attribute to the links that we want to change the behavior of. When this attribute is present **the link looks for and redraws the Turbo Frame specified in it**.

Both of those have a special value `_top` that will refer to the **entire page**.

Since we want to render a totally new view when a user clicks on the concert name use the `_top` value in this case makes sense. Our new link now looks like this:
```ruby
<%= link_to(
	concert.name, 
	concert,
	data: {"turbo-frame": "_top"}
) %>
```
With the *Make Favorite* button instead we would like to update the part of the page that lists the new favourite concerts, we could solve with `_top` but we want to optimize for performance too so, as before, sending less data means faster pages.

To solve this issue the first thing we need to do is to wrap the partial `view/favorites/_list.html.erb` with `turbo_frame_tag("favorite-concerts")`, this will give as an `id` that we want to point to.

Now it's time to change the behavior of our *Make/Remove Favorite* buttons adding on those the `data-turbo-frame` attribute that points to the `id` that we just created.
```ruby
<% if current_user.favorite(concert) %>
	<%= button_to(
		"Remove Favorite",
		favorite_path(id: current_user.favorite(concert)),
		method: "delete",
		form: {data: {"turbo-frame": "favorite-concerts"}},
		class: SimpleForm.button_class
	) %>
<% else %>
	<%= button_to(
		"Make Favorite",
		favorites_path(concert_id: concert.id),
		method: "post",
		form: {data: {"turbo-frame": "favorite-concerts"}},
		class: SimpleForm.button_class
	) %>
<% end %>
```
Both `data-turbo-frame` attributes needs to be on the `form` that `button_to` creates, that's why we use the `form:` argument in the method.

Next, as we did for the `ConcertsController`, we need to change the `redirect_to` with the `render` in order to pass just the Turbo Frame that we want to display.

We change both the `create` and `destroy` actions with `render(partial: "favorites/list")`. Notice that in this case we explicitely tells Rails that we are rendering a `partial:` because we do not have any variable that holds a reference and helps us leverage the ActiveRecord naming convention.

If you test the *Make Favorite* button you'll soon notice that while our favorite section gets updated this time is the concert row that remains stale. This is happening because with `data-turbo-frame` we tell to the current Turbo Frame to **totally ignore** what is happening because the focus is switched to the new frame.

This issue can be solved with Turbo Streams.
