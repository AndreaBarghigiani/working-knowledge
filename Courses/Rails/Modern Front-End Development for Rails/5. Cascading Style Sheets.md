This chapter is pretty easy to read since I know CSS and the configuration is preatty easy. Anyway here's what I've highlighted in order to help my memory.
## Building CSS in webpack
Via Webpacker we can add support for CSS and processors like PostCSS or Sass, to do this we need to install some packages:
```shell
$ yarn add css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin
$ yarn add css-minimizer-webpack-plugin
$ yarn add sass sass-loader
$ yarn add postcss-loader
```
Once the installation ends we need to change `config/webpack/base.js` to allow CSS file to be resolved:
```js
const { webpackConfig, merge } = require("@rails/webpacker")
const ForkTSCheckerWebpackPlugin = require("fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin")

const customConfig = {
  plugins: [new ForkTSCheckerWebpackPlugin()],
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".css"],
  },
}

module.exports = merge(webpackConfig, customConfig)
```
And for Tailwind we need to install it as a Node mocule with other tools:
```shell
$ yarn add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
$ yarn add postcss-import postcss-flexbugs-fixes postcss-preset-env
```
It is also required a `postcss.config.js` at the root to reflect those tools:
```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('postcss-import'),
    require('postcss-flexbugs-fixes'),
    require('postcss-preset-env')({
      autoprefixer: {
        flexbox: 'no-2009'
      },
      stage: 3
    }),
    require('tailwindcss'),
    require('autoprefixer')
  ]
}
```
Now that we set up everything we're ready to load the styles inside our `app/packs/entrypoints/application.scss`:
```scss
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```
All we need to do now Rails-wise is to actually load the stylesheet from the template with the following code before the closing `<head>`:
```rb
<%= stylesheet_pack_tag("application") %>
```
## Add CSS and Assets to webpack
To use static file assets with Webpacker in our code or CSS we need to tell it where to get 'em, basically we need to import them into Webpacker that will give us some helper methods to access the files.

To add images into our application, the default folder is at `app/packs/images`, we need to add the following code into `app/packs/entrypoints/application.js`:
```js
const images = require.context("../images", true)
const imagePath = (name) => images(name, true)
```
In the first line we use the webpack methos `require.context` to add the entire directory, and subfolders, into our pack. We can also add different `require.context` to load other assets like *fonts*, *video* or anything else.

`imagePath` instead is the method that we can export and use with other JavaScript file to get the path of an image via its name. Basically this setup allows us to access any image stored in `app/packs/images` in different ways:
- **from JavaScript** we can use `imagePath` as `imagePath("./cat.jpg")`, remember that it's essential to use `./`. But we can also `import` a resource like `import Cat from "images/cat.svg"`
- **from SCSS** we simply refer to the image directly relative to the files we're in. If the SCSS file is at `app/packs/entrypoint/application.scss` we can refer the above cat image like so: `background-image: url("../images/cat.jpg");`.
- **in Rails view** we have two helper methods: `asset_pack_path` that takes the name of the asset and generates a path to retrieve it, and also `image_pack_tag` that generates an `<img>` element able to show the image.
## Other notes
The chapter goes on adding simple animation handled via Stimulus and more complex ones with `animate.css`, give them a read if you can just to get a refresher of Stimulus but beside that there's not much interesting aspect (at least for me). 

Surely a mention of honor goes to how we can [add a class to an element before Turbo Stream removes it from the DOM](https://discuss.hotwired.dev/t/are-transitions-and-animations-on-hotwire-roadmap/1547/20). All of this is done via `data-*` attributes that respects the approach taken until now.

At the end we see how to install and use *styled-components* in React but still, there are better and more in depth resources to learn this approach. Just read it that part if you're curious to understand how to configure your application to integrate it as best as you can.
