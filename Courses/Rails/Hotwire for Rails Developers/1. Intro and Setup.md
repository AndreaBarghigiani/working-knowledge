At the beginning there was *Turboliinks* that intercept every click sending AJAX GET requests and that made possible to replace just the `body` but it was not useful to change part of a page.

Then RAILS AJAX HELPERS came to the rescue adding the `data-remote="true"` attribute.

# Hotwire approach
- **Turbo Drive** - still replaces the entire `body` and merges the `head`
- **Turbo Frames** - let us update only part of the `body`, to separate the part of the page that we want to update we can use the `<turbo-frame>` tagwith unique id
