Most of the time, the best timing for an animation is between 200ms and 300ms because the average human reaction time is 215ms.

But this is not true for any animation we have on a page.

For instance, when a user hovers over a button, we can reduce the timing even further than the average. This is because the user's eyes are already focused on the element, especially if the change involves `color` and `opacity`, allowing us to lower it to 150ms.

For modals, you can experiment and set different timings for the open and close effect. For example, you can use 200ms while opening and 150ms for closing since the user is done with the content inside the modal.

## The bigger is the element, the longer is the animation
If your animation involves a massive change in the UI, consider letting the animation last longer so the user can understand what's happening and appreciate the animation.

## Frequent actions do not require animations
Most of the time, you add animations because you want to amaze the user, but if your animation is applied to something that's frequently used, consider removing it altogether.

Having animations on elements that the user uses frequently only adds a feeling of slowness to our app and annoys the user.
