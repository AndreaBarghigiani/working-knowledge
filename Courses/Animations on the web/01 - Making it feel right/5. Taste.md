Taste is highly subjective; all of us doing creative work will have it. Most of the time, you'll feel something is off, but you cannot spot why.

This is your taste that is asking to be improved.

And how do you improve your taste?

By **continuously creating and refining your work**, you will gradually see your taste align with your creations, marking significant personal growth in your creative journey. 

> Taste is the ability to form opinions with your gut that you can justify with your head.

## Learn from the best
Surround yourself with excellent work. This will enable you to craft better things yourself.

In the specific context of animations, the most important thing you can do is to **recreate the good animations** everyone is talking about. Since animations are complex to understand even at 1x speed, record them and scrub through the video.

This way, you'll be able to spot every little detail, and it'll help you craft your skills and taste.

## Care
Taste alone can't go very far, but if you **care** about your craft, it can.
