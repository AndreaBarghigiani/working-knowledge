You need to decide the easing of an animation based on the component you're creating.

> **Hint:** most of the time a `linear` easing is never gonna be a good choice because it makes the animation feel robotic and in nature there is no such thing as linear.

An animation feels right when it feels natural and has a meaning.

Remember that you can accomplish a lot with easing, but there are always easing functions that work best with a specific kind of animation.

## Meaning
Since we can animate, this does not mean that we should animate everything on a screen. An animation should link actions to consequences in a logical and understandable way.
