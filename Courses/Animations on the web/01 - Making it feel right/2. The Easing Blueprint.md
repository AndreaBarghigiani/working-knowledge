The easing describes the rate at which something changes over a period of time.

## [Perception of speed](https://animations.dev/learn/making-it-feel-right/the-easing-blueprint#perception-of-speed)

Easing also plays an important role in how fast our interfaces feel, so it's absolutely crucial to get it right, as the perception of speed is often times more important than the actual performance of your app.

### ease-out
Great for user-initiated interactions like opening a modal, its acceleration at the beginning gives the user a feeling of responsiveness.

Beside the custom `ease-out` value we can leverage some custom made ones:
```css
:root {
  --ease-out-quad: cubic-bezier(.25, .46, .45, .94);
  --ease-out-cubic: cubic-bezier(.215, .61, .355, 1);
  --ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1);
  --ease-out-quint: cubic-bezier(.23, 1, .32, 1);
  --ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(.19, 1, .22, 1);
  --ease-out-circ: cubic-bezier(.075, .82, .165, 1);
}
```

### ease-in-out
Starts slowly, speeds up and then slows down towards the end, like a car. This is the most satisfying curve to look at in my opinion. I use it for anything that is already on the screen and needs to move to a new position, or morph into a new form.

Customs:
```css
:root {
  --ease-in-out-quad: cubic-bezier(.455, .03, .515, .955);
  --ease-in-out-cubic: cubic-bezier(.645, .045, .355, 1);
  --ease-in-out-quart: cubic-bezier(.77, 0, .175, 1);
  --ease-in-out-quint: cubic-bezier(.86, 0, .07, 1);
  --ease-in-out-expo: cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-in-out-circ: cubic-bezier(.785, .135, .15, .86);
}
```

### ease-in
It's the opposite ofÂ `ease-out`, it starts slowly and ends fast. Due to its slow start, it should generally be avoided as it can make interfaces feel sluggish and less responsive.

Custom:
```css
:root {
  --ease-in-quad: cubic-bezier(.55, .085, .68, .53);
  --ease-in-cubic: cubic-bezier(.550, .055, .675, .19);
  --ease-in-quart: cubic-bezier(.895, .03, .685, .22);
  --ease-in-quint: cubic-bezier(.755, .05, .855, .06);
  --ease-in-expo: cubic-bezier(.95, .05, .795, .035);
  --ease-in-circ: cubic-bezier(.6, .04, .98, .335);
}
```
