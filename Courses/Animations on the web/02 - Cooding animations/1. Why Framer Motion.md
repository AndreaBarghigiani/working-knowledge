Framer Motion is the go-to solution for this course because it is focused on React and has some utilities that other libraries do not have. For example:
- **layout animations**: the ability to tell FM that two different components will be *connected* by our animation
- **presence animations**: the ability to animate an element that will not be present or will be removed from the DOM
- **spring animations**: really simple to create
- **you can make in CSS**: almost all the animation you will create with FM can be ported to CSS; it just requires more code.

While the documentation follows the "happy path" and does not go much deeper, causing confusion while debugging an animation that does not behave as it should, there are many materials available to help you figure out the bug.
