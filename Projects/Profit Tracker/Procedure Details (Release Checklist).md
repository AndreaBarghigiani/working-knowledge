#### User creates a new project

^d8e013

When a user creates a new project, he'll be asked to create a first deposit simultaneously. Technically speaking, a deposit is the creation of a **transaction** of `type=DEPOSIT`. This means that money is **moving out** from the user's wallet and put to work.

The amount deposited is then added to the `totalDeposit` column of the `wallet` table.
