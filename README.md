# Working Knowledge
This is my private, well public, vault where I save all the things I learn working as a Frontend Developer.

The structure will change in future and also I use this place just to record my discoveries. If you're looking for something that has more structure feel free to jump on my [personal blog](https://cupofcraft.dev/) (still in its early stage), or if you speak Italian you can check my [SkillsAndMore](https://skillsandmore.org).

Hope you'll find something useful and if you're wondering on what kind of tool I am using it's called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a really nice markdown editor that'll help you create your knowledge graph.
